<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I started coding in 2023 when I took a Python computer programming class for "free grades." 
  To my surprise, I ended up enjoying coding very much, found it very rewarding, and 
  decided to pursue it as my career. I have learnt Python and I am now currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  Of course, this is only the beginning.

  I am a freshman studying Software Engineering at McGill University in the Engineering Department.
  I listen to K-pop and like cats.
